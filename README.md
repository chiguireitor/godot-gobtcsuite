godot-gobtcsuite
================

A bundled version of btcsuite/btcd to use as GDNative.

To build on linux:

    go get github.com/shadowapex/godot-go/godot
    go get github.com/btcsuite/btcd
    make

Then copy "bin" to your project.

Still testing, eventually will release instructions for the rest of the
platforms and binary releases.

The file `sample.gd` contains a sample script to handle wallet creation.
